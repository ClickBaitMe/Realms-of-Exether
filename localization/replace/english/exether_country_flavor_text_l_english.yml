  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Empire of Dumonia is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The Nightfall led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. It must grapple with a host of internal problems lest it be reduced to an even more humiliating state. Internal divides and external enemies, the Empire will have to tackle and resolve those issues before it can even consider looking West to restore its former glory."
  JUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Inquisitor calls upon the flame of the mighty, holy Kamiros, god of light. He calls unto the bright judge to vanquish all whom sin heinously under the cover of night. This land has incurred the punishment of the nightbane, and Jurian answers the call. With fanatic fervor, he has established a foothold for the inquisition to carry out retribution and return these green pastures to the righteous. This expedition will prove his faith and spread the truth of Kamiros to the ignorant. May the night horrors fear, for the sunkissed have arrived."
  YAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yanger Nomads are a people hailing from the the vast steppes of the western reaches of Noricum. Historically, these lands were a former imperial province of Dumonia, the land ripe for wealthy Dumonian ranchers.  However, it was not the wealthy Dumonian landowner who would come to rule the steppe; but the horselords of the Yanger and their riders.  Now, Dumonia has retreated to its' heartland, and these steppes lay in control of men hardened by war. With much talk of magic and the return of the gods, people look for an answer. In the eternal skies of the steppes exists a chaotic storm, serving as a prophecy for the many religious of forthcoming change. The steppe-riders lie prepared to weather the storm once more."
  AUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Order of the Sun is a dominion within the Dumonian Empire. It is a small, although powerful, semi-independent theocratic state that serves as the centre of the faith for the Cult of the Sun. The state is said to be guided directly by Holy Kamiros, Lord of Light, with the high priest merely acting as their interpreter. The Bright Judge works to uphold this righteous land as a haven for all believers by driving away darkness and spreading his divine nature through his holy word. This sacred land is a beacon for all who seek Kamiros and his teachings."
  CER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Arrador's victory against the Dumonian Empire during the Viceroy's War divorced Ceraun from the Empire against its own will. Hostile to its new neighbors and dependent on Dumonia, Ceraun has sold out its industry to imperial aristocrats. Will Ceraun continue its existince as a buffer state for foreign powers or can a new Cerunite state emerge beneath the shadow of the Empire?"
  BDB_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Buramog Wars, a series of conflicts opposing Ceraun to the Buramog Orcish clans, have left the Orcish lands blighted as the Cerunite's Wyldfire Tincture, a powerful chemical agent, have withered the once-lush fields and forests. Surviving in the now-called Plaguewood, can the martial traditions of the Buramogs keep protecting the Orcs against Human and Elvish aggression?"

  SMA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Halfling Principality of Smallshore-Gladcross, placed on the coast between Arrador and Ceraun, enjoys a positive relationship with its powerful neighbors as an important exporter of goods. This balance is however increasingly fragile as the two powers desire to expand their market south of the Principality, in the resource-full Moorweald and Whiskerfields. Will Smallshore-Gladcross manage to protect its independence while many citizens call the monarchy to safeguard the oppressed Halfling minority in Ceraun?"

  WHI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Largely untouched by outside influence, the Whiskerfields seemingly exists as an idyllic agricultural country. Beneath the surface, however, brews a crisis born of the fertile fields and agricultural breakthroughs; overpopulation! The advent of industry and railroads in neighboring countries may catalyze the unemployed masses of Whiskerfield to venture out into the world. As technology and hawkish neighbors erode the mousefolk way of life, each citizen will have to ask themselves the question; will you be man or mouse?"
  DAR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The conclusion of the Nightfall saw the Dwarves of Mount Yelfis awaken from their self-entombment surrounded on all sides by unfamiliar faces and even more unfamiliar technology. Utterly encircled, the Dwarves were swift to interact with their industrious neighbors and learn of new innovations. Decades later, this early necessity of curiosity has paid off handily as Darvak now stands as a giant of industry in the region. It now stands at the precipice of yet another massive societal shift as Yelfie leaders compete to carve out Darvak's path as an regional powerhouse...or perhaps something even greater?"
  EMP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Similar to Arrador, Emparal was a prospering province during the height of the Dumonian Empire. Similar to Arrador, Emparal fought for its independence in the Viceroy's War following the chaos of the Nightfall. Whilst Arrador did most of the heavy lifting,in this conflict, Emparal also contributed significant manpower and logistical support to the effort. Today Emparal continues to prosper as one of the richest nations along Settler's Coast. Will it settle for remaining in its 'Big Brother's' shadow to the North or will it carve out an Empire to the South? It faces a slew of issues such as the Orcs to their southern frontier and monitoring the developing political situation of the Darvak dwarves to its North. One wrong move could potentially undo decades of prosperity for the enlightened Bossardi state..."
  KRC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The province of Mistreach has long been a vital crossroads between Arrador and Emparal. The flow of goods helped solidify the "Mistreachan" provincial identity and its dependence on both Emparal and Arrador left it with no choice but to side with them during the Viceroy's War. Despite this, Emparal would still cast its shadow of influence over Mistreach in the coming decades after the war. Culminating in establishing a Personal Union and renaming it to the Principality of Kracia instead. For the people of Mistreach it remains unlikely they will ever have true self-determination. Though...Settler's Coast's relatively quiet political situation seems to be on the verge of an upheaval with its orchestrators yet to be revealed. Perhaps 'Kracia' can find opportunity to the South of Lake Bossard or maybe even at the peaks of Mount Yelfis? Kracia may yet be able to ride this tide of change...or perhaps it will be drowned beneath it?" 
  PRI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Prilyra is the famed breadbasket of the Settler's Coast. During the Viceroy's war, Prilyra had remained loyal to the empire, the sleepy rural communities saw little reason in marching from their homes for so-called 'Independence'. Unfortunately for them, they chose the losing side of that war. Swarmed over by the Rebelling provinces and promptly forced into the Astral Consortium that formed following Dumonia's defeat. A gentle hand during the occupation kept relations with the Prilyran people at a calm state. Decades have passed since and little has changed for the Wealder people of Prilyra. They are a simple farming society and above all simply wish to be left alone. The world can change as much as it pleases, for Prilyrans? As long as harvests are good, life is good and they will fight to guarantee that if needed."
  TLD_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Tolorri are a splinter group of the Vozi, who left their mountainous homeland in the south. They journeyed north from Skypiercer Peak, passing through the Enelli state of Serbinelle, and eventually settled in the borderlands of Vozmead. Here, they thrived despite facing the harsh environment. To the south lay the Nogi Desert, with its seemingly endless sands, and to the north, a hostile wasteland teeming with mutated creatures created by human recklessness. Confining the Tolorri to their newfound home. Recently in a twist of fate despite the Tolorri's original choice to separate from their Southern kin, the Tolorri dwarves find themselves currently influenced heavily by their Vozi kin who played a major role in their recent industrialization. Now reciding as a part of the Vozmead-lead trade league, Silt Winds."
  VOZ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "When the Vozi Dwarves emerged from their Hold following their long slumber, they found their ancestral lands arid and inhospitable. Through ingenuity, they overcame environmental hurdles through by utilizing mountaintop glaciers for water in combination with mountainside terrace farms.\nMore recently, the arrival of the Aridrun elves has sparked a renaissance for both the dwarves and the newcomers. The two races find themselves complementing each other in culture, trade and politics. The Chimesilt trade, previously an odd niche of the Nogi Sands, has made the region very wealthy thanks to an ever-growing demand abroad.\nWill the airships flying the routes of the 'Silt Wind" herald a new future for the Vozmead Peaks, or will history remember them as the beginning of a dark turn in dwarven history?"
  TLE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Once the seat of Human power in the far west; Thaloria now stands on the brink of dissolution. Revanchist Gnomes of the rising Necrostate, Ravik to its north have been the architects behind defeat after humiliating defeat for the once 'unbeatable' Thalorian Empire. Already two 'Crusades' waged by the Raviki have seen success and shattered the western part of Thaloria. Eager to finish the job, the Raviki have begun their Third and potentially final Crusade against the remnants of Thaloria. West Thaloria may be currently lost but there is still hope in the East. As Raviki troops and Soulwrought Battle-thralls march on Thaloria there will be no shortage of patriots willing to lay down their lives for the sake of Thaloria. The Lacustrines are committed to preserving their proud heritage and repelling these foul Necromantic Gnomes! Onwards! For Thaloria! The Age of Men will never end!"
  RAV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Gnomes of Ravik were once a simple, primitive society. This stature left them open to the expansionism of their southern Human neighbors, Thaloria. Pushed to the coast and oppressed for decades these Gnomes felt no other choice but to embrace the Dark Art of Necromancy when one of their own discovered its secrets, Hasal Nezzelech. Through hate in their hearts for Mankind and their exploitation of the dead, the Raviki have formed a powerful Meritocracy which has surged past that of the decadent Thalorians and handed these brazen fools defeat after defeat. Already two successful Crusades against this abhorrent Empire have come and gone, and the third begins on this day to finally shatter these ancient oppressors of the Gnomish people. The Soulwrought are ready to prove their worth to their creators to join Raviki society and the Gnomes of Ravik stand united to dissolve Thaloria and bring about the the Gnomish Age in Fraesoh! Onwards! The Age of Men is finished!"
 
 GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Magic and gods are new and world-changing concepts to the people of Exether. In some places, it has given rise to new religions or a return to ancient traditions, but in others, it has inspired intense scientific study. What new challenges will this new and rapidly changing world bring?"
